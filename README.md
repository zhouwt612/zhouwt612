Hi, My name is Zhou, Wentao (周文涛). Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree at Korea University in South Korea. I belong to the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialization in wireless communication systems. My research interest includes physical wireless communications and robust signal processing. 

I am very open to have a discussion on the above fields. Please feel free to contact me 😁
